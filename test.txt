learn tools and techniques for using APIs as intended. Next, you’ll probe 
them for vulnerabilities and learn how to exploit those vulnerabilities. You 
can then report your findings and help prevent the next data breach.
 The Allure of Hacking Web APIs
 In 2017, The Economist, one of the leading sources of information for inter
national business, ran the following headline: “The world’s most valuable 
resource is no longer oil, but data.” APIs are digital pipelines that allow a 
precious commodity to flow across the world in the blink of an eye.
 Simply put, an API is a technology that enables communication 
between different applications. When, for example, a Python application 
needs to interact with the functionality of a Java app, things can get messy 
very quickly. By relying on APIs, developers can design modular applica
tions that leverage the expertise of other applications. For example, they no 
longer need to create their own custom software to implement maps, pay
ment processors, machine-learning algorithms, or authentication processes.
 As a result, many modern web applications have been quick to adopt 
APIs. Yet new technologies often get quite a head start before cybersecurity 
has a chance to ask any questions, and APIs have hugely expanded these 
applications’ attack surfaces. They’ve been so poorly defended that attack
ers can use them as a direct route to their data. In addition, many APIs 
lack the security controls that other attack vectors have in place, making 
them the equivalent of the Death Star’s thermal exhaust port: a path to 
doom and destruction for businesses.
 Due to these reasons, Gartner predicted years ago that by 2022, APIs 
will be the leading attack vector. As hackers, we need to secure them by 
putting on our rollerblades, strapping the Acme rocket to our backs, and 
catching up to the speed of technological innovation. By attacking APIs, 
reporting our findings, and communicating risks to the business, we can do 
our part to thwart cybercrime.
 This Book’s Approach
 Attacking APIs is not as challenging as you may think. Once you under
stand how they operate, hacking them is only a matter of issuing the right 
HTTP requests. That said, the tools and techniques typically leveraged to 
perform bug hunting and web application penetration testing do not trans
late well to APIs. You can’t, for instance, throw a generic vulnerability scan 
at an API and expect useful results. I’ve often run these scans against vul
nerable APIs only to receive false negatives. When APIs are not tested prop
erly, organizations are given a false sense of security that leaves them with a 
risk of being compromised a chance to ask any questions, and APIs have hugely expanded these
